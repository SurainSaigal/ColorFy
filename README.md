# ColorFy
A prototype of a tool used to generate color-coded graphic of a user's top albums in Spotify.

These two files, color.py and create.py, are meant to show an in-development prototype of how I access the Spotify API and sort images by color into a collage.
Create.py is where the heavy lifting occurs. Colors.py simply has a color dictionary and a few color sorting algorithm. Stopwatch.py is for timing purposes only.

This project is NOT complete, and these files are for documentation only. Development is still being made to integrate these processes into a web application.
