# ColorFy
A prototype of a tool used to generate color-coded graphic of a user's top albums in Spotify.

These two files, color.py and create.py, are meant to show an in-development prototype of how I access the Spotify API and sort images by color into a collage.
Create.py is where the heavy lifting occurs. Colors.py simply has a color dictionary and a few color sorting algorithms. Stopwatch.py is for timing purposes only.

This project is NOT complete. Development is still being made to integrate these processes into a web application.

To see a current prototype, clone this repo and run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" or "pip install -r requirements.txt". Then, run create.py.

All code authored by me.
