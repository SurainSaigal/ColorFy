# ColorFy
A prototype of a tool used to generate color-coded graphic of a user's top albums in Spotify.

These two files, color.py and create.py, are meant to show an in-development prototype of how I access the Spotify API and sort images by color into a collage.
Create.py is where the heavy lifting occurs. Colors.py simply has a color dictionary and a closest color sorting algorithm. 

This project is NOT complete, and these files are for documentation only. Development is still being made to integrate these processes into a web application.
